        "description": "Develop the Python script for `llm_correction`. This script will parse the `source.srt` file, send only the dialogue text to the Gemini API for correction, and then reconstruct a `cleaned.srt` file, preserving all original timestamps.",
        "details": "Implements P.2.1 and P.2.2. The script must include robust SRT parsing/reconstruction logic. The prompt sent to Gemini must contain strong instructions to only correct grammar and phrasing, without altering the timecodes.",
        "testStrategy": "Process a sample `source.srt` file. Compare the input `source.srt` and output `cleaned.srt` files. Verify that timestamps are identical, and only the dialogue text has been modified.",
